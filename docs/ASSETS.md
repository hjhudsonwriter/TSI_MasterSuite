# Assets

Every image, sound and video brought across from the old repos, and where it now lives. CLAUDE.md's rule is to bring **every** media file across, including ones the old tools never used. Byte-for-byte duplicates are stored once, and every old location that shared a file is listed here. Files the old tools never used go in the tool's `assets/extras/`.

**How to read the tables**
- **Old path** is relative to `_legacy/` (the old repos, cloned for reference and never committed).
- **Used** means the rebuilt suite actually shows or plays the file.
- Each tool's phase adds its own section.

Third-party files (fonts and libraries) are listed in `licences/README.md`, not here.

## Shared art (phase 1)

| New path | Old path(s) | Size | Used | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `shared/art/logo-hub.png` | `scarlett-isles-dnd/assets/logo.png` | 2.86 MB, 1400 × 1400, transparent | Yes: home screen and top bar | The old hub's crest logo. Harry chose it as the suite logo. |
| `shared/art/hero.png` | `scarlett-isles-dnd/assets/hero.png` = `scarlett-isles-explorer/assets/hero.png` = `clan-crest-creator/assets/hero.png` | 3.28 MB, 1536 × 1024 | Yes: home-screen background, and behind the Clan Crest Creator (phase 2) | Three byte-identical copies, stored once. The Explorer will use it too. |
| `shared/art/logo-crest-wide.png` | `clan-crest-creator/assets/logo.png` = `scarlett-isles-explorer/assets/logo.png` = `scarlettisles-encounter-tracker/logo.png` | 3.00 MB, 1536 × 1024 | Not yet | The wide crest the old Explorer, Crest and Tracker used in their headers. Three identical copies, stored once. The Combat Tracker keeps it as its faint watermark (phase 7). |

Both logos and the hero art carry embedded Content Credentials naming ChatGPT as the creator. See `licences/ARTWORK.md`.

## Clan Crest Creator (phase 2)

The old tool had two pictures, both already stored once in `shared/art/` (above). It had no sounds, videos or unused art, so it has no `tools/crest/assets/` folder.

| Old path | New path | Used | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clan-crest-creator/assets/hero.png` | `shared/art/hero.png` | Yes: the painted background behind the Crest Creator, as in the old tool | Byte-identical to the hub's and the Explorer's copies. |
| `clan-crest-creator/assets/logo.png` | `shared/art/logo-crest-wide.png` | Not by the Crest | The old tool showed it in its own header. The suite's top bar replaces that header, so the Crest no longer shows it. It's kept for the Combat Tracker's watermark (phase 7). |
| `clan-crest-creator/assets/.keep` | (not copied) | No | An empty placeholder file, not art. |

The crest itself is drawn by code (`tools/crest/draw.js`), not from picture files. The motto font packed into downloaded PNGs is listed in `licences/README.md`.
